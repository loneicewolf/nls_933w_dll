This repository is dedicated to the theoretical research and analysis of the REPLACE_NAME malware. For safety reasons, the actual malware samples are not included here. They can be found in my other repository focused on REPLACE_RELATED_REPO. Additionally, for related research, you might want to check my other repositories.

## Introduction

REPLACE_NAME is a malware that targets storage device firmware, specifically HDD/SSD firmware, making it a boot/rootkit. **In a nutshell, that's REPLACE_NAME**.

### Purpose

This repository is a collection of REPLACE_NAME-related files gathered from various sources to make it more accessible for researchers and antivirus developers. The repository includes:
- **Binary/Raw files**
- **Memory and Hardware Dumps (`JTAG`/`UART`)**
- **Sample Firmwares (before and after with diff)**

### Why This Repository?

REPLACE_NAME is nearly impossible to find on the internet. I discovered it on one of my hard drives as part of a sample collection. This repository aims to consolidate information and resources related to this elusive malware.

## Malware Samples

***
* See the [ONLY_MALWARE](https://github.com/loneicewolf/nls_933w_dll/tree/ONLY_MALWARE) branch for the malware.
***




- If you see `need PK compat. v5.1 (can do v4.6)`, you need to install `engrampa` on Linux. I use Qubes for malware and Engrampa to pack infected archives.
